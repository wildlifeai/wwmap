# Wild Life Map

This application provides live updates about sighting of snails and rodents

## Getting Started

This is a small proof of concept that includes:
- (Authentication with Google)
- Map of New Zealand, split by regions
- The map is interactive and shows(simulates) live updates about different sighting of animals.
